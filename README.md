# PHONEBOOK

#### This is a small phonebook created in pure python.

A terminal based phonebook that keeps records of:

- FIRSTNAME
- LASTNAME
- EMAIL ADDRESS
- PHONE NUMBER

You can add record, search for record and delete record.<br>
The records are stored in a pikle file and will be updated to a sqlit db.<br>
This is just a simple project to show how to validate user input, search through<br>a dictonary with a binary search, edit and update an exiting ditonary.

Feel free to fork and make changes to this project.
